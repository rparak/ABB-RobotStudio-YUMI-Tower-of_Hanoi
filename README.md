## Project Description:
The project demonstrates the mathematical problem of the Tower of Hanoi, which is solved by the collaborative robot YuMi (IRB 14000). To solve the problem, we use a Python script to generate the data with additional dependencies and ABB RobotStudio to process the data and generate the trajectory. 

The program uses both arms (T_ROB_L/R) to move the rings (1 to 6) between the three towers using special fingers that were created on a 3D printer.

Note:
The goal of the game is to transfer the ring from the first tower to the last one. However, you are allowed to move only one ring at a time and never put a big one over a small one. The minimum number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^n - 1, where n is the number of rings.

**The project demonstrates two methods of solving the problem Tower of Hanoi:**

Method 1: The standard solution of the problem is performed by one hand and the inverse by the other.

Method 2: Synchronization of the movement of both arms in the standard and inverse solution of the problem.

**Generate data to solve the math problem Tower in Hanoi with additional dependencies:**
```bash
Windows:
    $ py -3.6 toh_solver.py
Linux:
    $ python3 toh_solver.py

# The number of rings to solve the Hanoi Tower problem.
n = 3

# Display the result in the console.

OUTPUT := [[2, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1], [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0], [2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1], [2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2]]

OUTPUT := [[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3], [1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1]]
```

The project was created in collaboration with student Lukas Stanek within the [VRM (Programming for Robots and Manipulators)](https://github.com/rparak/Programming-for-robots-and-manipulators-VRM) university course.

The project was realized at the Institute of Automation and Computer Science, Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (NETME Centre - Cybernetics and Robotics Division).

**Unpacking a station (/Final/Solution_YuMi.rspag):**
1. On the File tab, click Open and then browse to the folder and select the Pack&Go file, the Unpack & Work wizard opens.
2. In the Welcome to the Unpack & Work Wizard page, click Next.
3. In the Select package page, click Browse and then select the Pack & Go file to unpack and the Target folder. Click Next.
4. In the Library handling page select the target library. Two options are available, Load files from local PC or Load files from Pack & Go. Click the option to select the location for loading the required files, and click Next.
5. In the Virtual Controller page, select the RobotWare version and then click Locations to access the RobotWare Add-in and Media pool folders. Optionally, select the check box to automatically restore backup. Click Next.
6. In the Ready to unpack page, review the information and then click Finish.
